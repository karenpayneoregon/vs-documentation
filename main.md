### Keyboard shortcuts by menu

Sometimes the best method to learn keyboard shortcuts is by menu. The common shortcuts are shown in the menu. For example, the following shows the `Edit` menu.

> Some shortcuts are in submenus. For example, the `Edit` menu has a submenu called `Advanced`. The `Advanced` submenu has the `Format Document` and `Format Selection` shortcuts.

### Edit a file via splitting horizontally

Click on the following and drag down to split the window horizontally.

## The toolbox

Generally, the toolbox is used to drag and drop controls onto a form. But it can also be used to store code snippets as shown below.

Example, you have a line of code that you use frequently. You can drag and drop the code into the toolbox. To use the code snippet, drag and drop the code snippet from the toolbox to the code editor.
